# [Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing#about)

Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to interpret and manipulate human language.

In the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Specialization, you will learn how to design NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, create tools to translate languages, summarize text, and even build chatbots. These and other NLP applications will be at the forefront of the coming transformation to an AI-powered future.

NLP is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning and is critical in effectively analyzing massive quantities of unstructured, text-heavy data. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.

# Applied Learning Project
This Specialization will equip you with machine learning basics and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques needed to build cutting-edge NLP systems:

â€¢ Use logistic regression, naÃ¯ve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies, translate words, and use locality-sensitive hashing to approximate nearest neighbors.

â€¢ Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to autocorrect misspelled words, autocomplete partial sentences, and identify part-of-speech tags for words.

â€¢ Use dense and recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs, and Siamese networks in TensorFlow and Trax to perform advanced sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition, and to identify duplicate questions.

â€¢ Use encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention to perform advanced machine translation of complete sentences, text summarization, question-answering, and to build chatbots. Learn T5, BERT, transformer, reformer, and more with ðŸ¤—  Transformers!

## [Course 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/classification-vector-spaces-in-nlp?specialization=natural-language-processing): Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces
In Course 1 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, you will:

a) Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then naÃ¯ve Bayes,<br>
b) Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, and<br>
c) Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality-sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.

### Week 1: Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression
    Learn how to extract features from text into numerical vectors, then build a binary classifier for tweets using logistic regression.

### Week 2: Sentiment Analysis with NaÃ¯ve Bayes
    Understand the theory behind Bayesâ€™ rule for conditional probabilities, then apply it toward building a Naive Bayes tweet classifier of your own.
### Week 3: Vector Space Models
    Vector space models capture semantic meaning and relationships between words. Youâ€™ll learn how to create word vectors that capture dependencies between words, then visualize their relationships in two dimensions using PCA.s

### Week 4: Machine Translation and Document Search
    Learn how to transform word vectors and assign them to subsets using locality-sensitive hashing to perform machine translation and document search.
